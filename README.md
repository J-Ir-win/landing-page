Project Landing Page

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project and involved recreating a landing page from scatch using only an image as refernce. 

The goal was to consolidate the skills learned in HTML and CSS, with a focus on Flexbox.

Approach 
The project commenced with structuring the HTML to reflect the major sections of the landing page. Elements were grouped using nested containers and class names to create a clear and logical structure.

This approach proved useful, as it allowed most layout adjustments to be made within the stylesheet with minial changes while keeping the CSS organised. 

Flexbox was used extensively to postion and align elements on the page, making it straightforward to replicate the layout shown in the reference design.

What I learned 
Structing HTML effectively before styling simplifies layout work 
Practical use of flexbox for allignment
Styling details such as rounded buttons and image placeholders
